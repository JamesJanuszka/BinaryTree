Binarytree 0.8

This is a beta of my Binarytree library, it is a collection of subroutines for the creation and manipulating of binary trees for the DCPU-16.
This is just a beta it is still missing a subroutine to prune nodes from the tree.

 --------------------------------------------
 Tree Specification
 --------------------------------------------
 Each node is 32 words long. The first three
 words are pointers, the next 28 words are 
 data, and the last word is 0x0000.

 null = 0xFFFF, this must be stored as a 
 variable in your program somewhere, eg

 :null DAT 0xFFFF
 --------------------------------------------
 Pointers
 --------------------------------------------
 EOT:
 Points to the next availble memory location
 after tree data.

 Parent: 
 Points to the memory location of the Parent
 node.

 LC:
 Memory location of left child node.

 RC:
 Memory location of Right child node.
 --------------------------------------------
 Node Structure
 --------------------------------------------
 Root Node:
 EOT, LC, RC, Data(28), 0x0000

 Branch Node:
 Parent, LC, RC, Data(28), 0x0000

 Leaf node:
 Parent, NULL, NULL, Data(28), 0x0000
 --------------------------------------------

Upcoming features in 1.0

Complete rewrite of fuctions, mainly merging the New Tree and AddNode functions, and change the way 
nodes are selected, ie not needing to reference them by memory loaction.
Modifying the Root node to not point to EOT.
Creating to header words, one to point to the root node, another to act as the EOT pointer
Subroutine for the deletion of nodes.
Pre-order traversal function.
Removal of the 28 word data limit.
Instead of the FillData routine filling the node with 0xFFFF, it will accept data from a buffer.
